# AI Chatbot: A Basic AI Application Using Python


This project demonstrates the creation of a simple AI chatbot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot acts as a conversational agent, responding to user inputs based on predefined rules and patterns. It is designed for beginners who want to explore AI and chatbot development.

# Features:

**Text Preprocessing:** Utilizes tokenization, lowercase conversion, and stopword removal for better understanding of user inputs.

**Interactive Functions:**
Greets users upon starting the chat.
Captures and uses the user's name during the conversation.
Responds to queries using keyword-based patterns.
Continues chatting until the user types "exit."

**Predefined Responses:** Handles simple queries like greetings or questions (e.g., "Which is the best US state?").
